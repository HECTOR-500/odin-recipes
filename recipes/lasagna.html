    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
   <img src="Images/Lasagna-Image.jpeg" alt="tasteful lasagna">
<p>Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,
    made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to
    an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating
    with fillings such as ragù, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings
    and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and
    basil.</p>  
   <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Step 1</h3></p>
        <p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, 
         and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir
         in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
         Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning,
         1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer,
         covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Step 2</h3></p>
           <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,
            combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2
            teaspoon salt.</p> 
    
    <p><h3>Step 3</h3></p>        
            <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

    <p><h3>Step 4</h3></p>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom
            of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over 
            meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.
            Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups
            meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan
            cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and
            Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
            spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not
            touch the cheese.</p>

    <p><h3>Step 5</h3></p>
             <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake
                an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
